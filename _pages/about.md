I am a fourth-year undergraduate student from [School of Mechatronics Engineering](https://smee.hainanu.edu.cn/), [Hainan University](https://www.hainanu.edu.cn/), majoring in Automation. My research interests include machine learning, embedded systems, and brain-computer interfaces. I have been recommended for postgraduate study at Xiamen University, with enrollment scheduled for September 2025.

I am honored to conduct academic research under the guidance of [Prof. Xiaofeng Xie](https://smee.hainanu.edu.cn/info/1025/1251.htm) at Hainan University. I have contributed to several projects related to brain-computer interfaces and artificial intelligence, including a wheelchair controlled by EEG signals and a lower limb rehabilitation system based on EEG signal decoding.
